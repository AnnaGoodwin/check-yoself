# Check Yo'Self

## Introduction

Check Yo'Self is my second solo project assigned in Module 1 at Turing. I was given a comp. with specific designs,
desktop and mobile, and functionality to recreate. I used HTML, CSS, and two JavaScript files. One file for our 'Ideas'
class and the other file to handle all other functionality.

## Overview

Check Yo'Self lets users create tasks via a form by entering their task and name and their To-Do-List details. It will allow users to save those tasks which will
persist on page load (saved to localStorage) plus allow them to edit their task title and its details. User’s can also creat urgent ideas, delete completed To-Do-Lists, and filter them based on those their contents. The search bar in the form will allow users to search through all of their ideas. Anytime a user would like to delete one of their To-Do-Lists they may click on the ‘X’ to remove it.
